# my-hackerrank-solutions-put

#### My takes on almost all (95 from 106?) python exercises that I managed to do from programming lectures at my uni. 
#### Some of these solutions may not be too brilliant or "pythonic", especially the ones from simple section (but still, they worked).

If I will have some free time maybe I will try to re-format their code but they work nevertheless.
